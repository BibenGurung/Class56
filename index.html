        <h2> <b>Where I was born</b></h2>
        <p>I was born in January 14th, 2009 in Nepal, Katmandu. I was born in the same hospital as my mom. I lived in Nepal for 8 years and then I camer to America since my family got the oppertunity to do so. </p>
        <br><br>
        <h2> <b>Life in Nepal</b></h2>
        <p> I lived in Katmandu, Thasikhel in Nepal and we lived in a 4 story house. We also had a big garden where we grew banannas, potatos, garlic, onions. avacados, etc. It was quite and I enjoyed Nepal.</p>
        <br><br>
        <h2><b>Life in America</b></h2>
        <br><br>
        <p>When I first moved into America, it was a bit hard to fit into the new enviroment. I was used to it in about 2 months. We were living at a relatives house for a few days and we finally got our own house where we lived with roommates. We eveutually moved because of noise and we moved to a different, more shady location where I actually made a lot of friends. We moved again and that is where I am currently living in 2022. It is a lot more quite and peacefull and there are a lot of things I can acess here.</p>
        <br><br>
        <h2><b>Future Plans</b></h2>
        <p>In the future, my parents are planning to move somewhere warmer than New York after I finish highschool. Currently, I plan on going to the specialized highschool of Brooklyn tech in New York.</p>
